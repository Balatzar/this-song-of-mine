# Build Command Restrictions

## Never Auto-Build

-   **NEVER** run `npm run build`, `npm run build-nolog`, or any build commands automatically
-   **NEVER** run `npm run dev`, `npm start`, or development servers automatically
-   **NEVER** test functionality by building or starting servers on your own

## When Testing is Needed

-   Inform the user that testing is recommended
-   Let the user decide when and how to run builds/servers
-   Only run build/dev commands if explicitly requested by the user

## Allowed Actions

-   Code compilation checks via linting tools are OK
-   Reading package.json scripts is OK for understanding
-   Checking if servers are already running (curl checks) is OK if explicitly needed

The user manages their own build/development process.
